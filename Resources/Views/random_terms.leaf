    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") govern your relationship with Decide Now application (the "Service") provided by Hoang Nguyen ("us", "we", or "our").
    </p>
    <p>
        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each time you access or use the Services, the current version of these Terms will apply. These Terms will always be available on the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Subscription(when applicable)</strong></p>
    <p>
        The Service is billed on an auto-renewing subscription basis ("Subscription(s)") by the Apple App Store to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you purchase a subscription to the Software, for which the subscription model is provided (a “Subscription”), you agree to pay the subscription price listed on the purchase page for the subscription period indicated thereon. Your Subscription will renew at the end of the subscription period at the then-current rate unless you cancel the Subscription before the end of the applicable subscription period. Additionally, when you purchase a Subscription, you authorize us to use the payment information we have on file for you to renew the Subscription as described herein. We may, but are not required to, contact you prior to the end of your Subscription to let you know that your Subscription will auto-renew. In case of a transaction failure when trying to charge you for renew of the Subscription, we may retry to fulfill the transaction repeatedly (but not more than 3 (three) times). If you are directed to our third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.
    </p>
    <p>
        In case of termination of the Subscription to the Software before expiration of the Subscription period  for some reasons provided by the legislation or these Terms, neither the Subscription price, nor its part shall not be refunded.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we are unable to collect payment for the renewed Subscription at the end of the subscription period, you will no longer be able to access the fully functional version of the Software. You will be able to access only Trial Version of the Software with renewed cleaning capacity limits, until you renew your Subscription. If you wish to reactivate your Subscription after access has been terminated, you will be required to pay only new Subscription payment for the reactivation without the necessity to pay the past-due Subscription payment.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
    <p>
        Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong></p>
    <p>
        You expressly agree that the services are available on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, and that your use thereof is at your own risk. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we disclaim to the maximum extent permitted by law any and all warranties, express or implied, including, without limitation, any (I) warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, (ii) warranties against infringement of any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights, (iii) warranties relating to delays, interruptions, errors, or omissions in the services, or any part thereof, (iv) warranties relating to the transmission or delivery of the services, (v) warranties relating to the accuracy or correctness of data, and any other warranties otherwise relating to performance, nonperformance, or other acts or omissions by us. Further, and without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing, there is no warranty that the services will meet your needs or requirements or the needs or requirements of any other person. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that our warranty does not cover telecommunications or internet outages caused by third parties or otherwise outside of our control. The services may be limited by many factors, including inherent risks of the internet.
